Ktisis is a robust posing tool for creating screenshots within FFXIV's GPose mode which allows you to pose characters by clicking on bones and moving them in any way you want, bringing additional features such as animation control and character editing. Our primary aim is to make posing more accessible for all.

Please feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kUG3W8B8Ny) to get in touch with developers and receive patch notes.

## Installation

Ktisis is available from the [Sea of Stars](https://github.com/Ottermandias/SeaOfStars/) repo alongside other commonly installed plugins.

Additionally, you will need to enable plugin testing builds in your Dalamud settings in order to opt into v0.3 releases.

If you wish to install the plugin from a standalone repo:

1. Type the `/xlsettings` command into your chatbox. This will open your Dalamud Settings.
2. In the window that opens, navigate to the "Experimental" tab. Scroll down to "Custom Plugin Repositories".
3. Copy and paste the repo URL (seen below) into the input box, **making sure to press the "+" button to add it.**
4. Press the "Save and Close" button. This will add Ktisis to Dalamud's list of available plugins.
5. Open the plugin installer by typing the `/xlplugins` command, search for Ktisis, and click install.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Feel free to reach out in the discord's #ktisis-dev channel if you want to work on something!

Be aware that changes to unsafe code may be subject to extra scrutiny due to the possibility of causing client crashes or unintended behaviour.

Most work is currently focused on the [v0.3/main](https://github.com/ktisis-tools/Ktisis/tree/v0.3/main) branch, which will supersede the current main branch when ready.
